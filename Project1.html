                                    <p>Impact of Interest Rates on the Economy and Banking Industry: A Predictive and Forecasting Analysis using Machine Learning and Time Series Models"<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Project Description</strong><br>
                                    <br>
                                    In this project, we delved into the intricate relationships between interest rates and various macroeconomic factors. Utilizing advanced data analysis, machine learning, and time series forecasting techniques, we aimed to predict interest rates and understand how changes in macroeconomic factors influence these rates. Our goal was to develop robust models and conduct sensitivity analysis to provide insights into the dynamics of the economy and the banking industry.<br>

                                    <strong>Problem Statement:</strong><br>
                                    <br>
                                    Interest rates are a critical component of economic stability and growth. They influence borrowing, investment, and consumer spending. This project aimed to predict future interest rates and analyze the impact of various macroeconomic factors on these rates. By leveraging machine learning and time series models, we sought to uncover complex relationships and provide accurate predictions to inform economic policy and decision-making.<br>
                                    <br>
                                    <strong>Data Collection</strong><br>

                                    To address this problem, we collected a comprehensive dataset comprising various macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, unemployment rate, weekly earnings, deposit rate, interest rate, and yield. This dataset enabled us to capture the diverse economic interactions and behaviors over time.<br>

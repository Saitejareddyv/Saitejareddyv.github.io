											<h3 class="major"><strong>W.H.O COVID-19 cases analysis</strong></h3>
											<p>In this project, we conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the COVID-19 pandemic, integrating multiple data sources. We examined the global spread of the virus using geographical data and analyzed the impact of socioeconomic factors on COVID-19 outcomes. We delved into mortality rates over time and compared daily new cases across different regions. Advanced visualizations were created to present the data in a meaningful and engaging manner, providing valuable insights for policymakers and researchers.</p>

											<h3 class="major"><strong>Economic Prediction Market (Interest rate)</strong></h3>
											<p>In this project, we delved into the intricate relationships between interest rates and various macroeconomic factors. Utilizing advanced data analysis, machine learning, and time series forecasting techniques, we aimed to predict interest rates and understand how changes in macroeconomic factors influence these rates. Our goal was to develop robust models and conduct sensitivity analysis to provide insights into the dynamics of the economy and the banking industry.</p>

											<p>I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to evaluate the determinants of Airbnb pricing and the appeal of locations in major European cities. By integrating and analyzing diverse datasets, the project uncovered key insights, such as the correlation between higher prices and proximity to attractions, and the impact of cleanliness on guest satisfaction. This work underscores the power of data visualization in enhancing decision-making within the short-term rental market.</p>
